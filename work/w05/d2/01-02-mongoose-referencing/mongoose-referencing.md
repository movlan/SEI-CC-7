---
#### Setup
<br>

- `cd` to `starter-code/mongoose-movies` folder within this lesson's folder in the class repo.

- Install the node modules:

	```
	$ npm install
	```
	
- Open the **`mongoose-movies`** folder in your code editor.

- Use `nodemon` to start the server.

- Browse to `localhost:3000`

---
#### Review the Starter Code
<br>

- Today's starter code is the final code from yesterday's _Mongoose - Embedding Related Data_ lesson with a couple of changes...

- The `cast` property on the `Movie` model has been removed and all related forms/views and controller code have been adjusted accordingly. This was done so that in this lesson we can reference _performer_ documents created using a `Performer` Model.

- The **movies/show.ejs** view shows how you can use EJS to calculate an _average rating_ for a movie.

---
#### Perform CRUD Using<br>Mongoose Models in a Node REPL
<br>

- Because of the removal of the `cast` property, we will want to start fresh by deleting the existing _movie_ documents.

- This provides another opportunity to perform CRUD operations in Terminal using a Node REPL session - something that you'll likely need to do when developing an app.

- Start by opening a terminal session and make sure that you are in the **mongoose-movies** folder.

---
#### Perform CRUD Using<br>Mongoose Models in a Node REPL
<br>

- Start a Node REPL:

	```sh
	$ node
	> 
	```

- Connect to the MongoDB database:

	```sh
	> require('./config/database')
	{}
	> Connected to MongoDB at localhost:27017
	// Press enter to return to the prompt
	```

---
#### Perform CRUD Using<br>Mongoose Models in a Node REPL
<br>

- Load the `Movie` Model:

	```sh
	> const M = require('./models/movie')
	```
	We're being concise by using a variable named "M" vs. "Movie"

- **Important:** If you make any changes to the Model, you'll have exit Node and start again.

---
#### Perform CRUD Using<br>Mongoose Models in a Node REPL<br>

- Log all _movie_ docs:

	```sh
	> M.find({}, (e, movies) => {
	... console.log(movies)
	... })
	```
	The `find` method returns a **Query** object that is first logged, followed by the _movie_ docs. Press enter to return to the prompt.

---
#### Perform CRUD Using<br>Mongoose Models in a Node REPL
<br>

- Anything that can be done with a Model in the app, can be done in the REPL including all CRUD operations.

- Next, let's remove all existing _movie_ documents...

---
#### Perform CRUD Using<br>Mongoose Models in a Node REPL
<br>

- Here's a way to delete all documents from a collection:

	```sh
	> M.deleteMany({}, (err, result) => console.log(result))
	...
	> { n: 3, ok: 1, deletedCount: 3 }
	```
	
- The _empty query object_ provided as the first argument matches all documents, so all documents were removed.

- Press `control + C` twice to exit the REPL.

---
#### Perform CRUD Using<br>Mongoose Models in a Node REPL
<br>

- For future reference, here's a gist that documents how to do what we just did:<br>[Perform CRUD Using Mongoose Models in a Node REPL](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/57b646abbb6c0ce09f9fa948eab6febc)

---
#### A New Data Resource: _Performers_
<br>

- We are going to implement the following data relationship:<br><br>**_A Movie has many Performers; A Performer has many Movies_**<br><br>**`Movie >--< Performer`** (Many-To-Many)

- But unlike we saw with Reviews (One-To-Many), multiple Movies can reference the same Performer creating a Many-To-Many relationship.  Here's a simplified example...

---

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hzoRC2y.png" width="70%">

---
#### 💪 Practice Exercise (5 minutes)
<br>

- A new data resource requires new modules, etc.

- Create the following for the new **Performers** resource:
	- Model (empty module)
	- Router (module exporting a router object)
	- Controller (empty module)
	- A dedicated folder for its views

- Require and mount the new router in **server.js** to the path of `/`.

---
#### Create the _Performer_ Model
<br>

- _Performers_ will be stored in their own collection so that their `_id` (ObjectId) can be referenced by numerous movies.

- As you know, models map to collections in Mongoose...

---
#### Create the _Performer_ Model

- We'll review the schema for the `Performer` Model as we type it:

	```js
	const mongoose = require('mongoose');
	const Schema = mongoose.Schema;
	
	const performerSchema = new Schema({
	  name: {type: String, required: true, unique: true},
	  born: Date
	}, {
	  timestamps: true
	});
	
	module.exports = mongoose.model('Performer', performerSchema);
	```

---
#### Referencing _Performers_ in the _Movie_ Model
<br>

- With the `Performer` Model created, we can now add back the `cast` property in `Movie`:

	```js
	reviews: [reviewSchema],
	// don't forget to add a comma above
	cast: [{type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Performer'}]
	```

- The property type of `ObjectId` **is always** used to implement **referencing**.

- The `ref: 'Performer'` is optional, but allows us to use the magical Mongoose method - `populate`. 

---
#### Contrasting 1:M and M:M Relationships
<br>

- The key difference between a `1:M` and a `M:M` relationship:
	- In a `1:M` relationship, each of the **many** (child) documents belongs to only **one** (parent) document. Each time we want add a new relationship - **the child document must be created**.
	- In a `M:M` relationship, **existing** documents are referenced and the same document can be referenced over and over. New documents are created only if it's the first of its kind. 

- What this means for **mongoose-movies** is that we only want to create a certain _performer_ once (when they don't exist).

---
#### Many:Many CRUD
<br>

- So, before a many-to-many relationship can be created between two documents (often called an **association**), those two documents must first exist.

- This requires that the app first provide the functionality to create each of the two resources independently of each other.

- **mongoose-movies** can already create _movies_, but now it needs the capability to create _performers_...

---
#### _AAU, I want to create a new performer if they don't already exist_
<br>

- Here's the flow we've now followed several times when adding functionality to the app:

	1. Identify the "proper" Route (Method + Path)
	
	2. Create the UI that will send the request matching that route.
	
	3. Define the route on the server and map it to the proper controller action (`index`, `show`, `new`, `create`, etc.).
	
	4. Code and export the controller action.
	
	5. `res.render` a view in the case of a GET request, or `res.redirect` if data was changed.

---
#### Creating _Performers_ - Step 1
<br>

- We will want a dedicated view for adding a performer, thus creating a performer will require two request/response cycles:  One for the `new` action and one for the `create` action...

- **💪 YOU DO: Reply in Slack with the proper routes (Method & Path) for**:
	- Displaying a page with a form for entering a _performer_
	- Creating a new _performer_ when the form is submitted

---
#### Creating _Performers_ - Step 2
<br>

- We need UI that will send the request to view the form...

- Let's add a new link in the nav bar in **partials/header.js**:

	```html
	<img src="/images/camera.svg">
	<!-- new menu link below -->
	<a href="/performers/new"
		<%- title === 'Add Performer' ? 'class="active"' : '' %>>
		ADD PERFORMER</a>
	```
	Yup, the same pattern as the other links.

---
#### Creating _Performers_ - Step 3
<br>

- Clicking the **ADD PERFORMER** link is going to send a `GET /performers/new` request - now we need a route to map that HTTP request to code (controller action) in **routes/performers.js**:

	```js
	const express = require('express');
	const router = express.Router();
	const performersCtrl = require('../controllers/performers');
	
	router.get('/performers/new', performersCtrl.new);
	
	module.exports = router;
	```

- As usual, the server won't be happy until we create and export that `new` action...

---
#### Creating _Performers_ - Step 4
<br>

- We want to try to prevent the users from creating more than one document for a given performer, so we will display a list of existing performers (in a dropdown) and beg our users not to add a performer unless they've verified that the performer does not already exist in the list.

- The controller action of course will need to provide an array of the exiting performers to be rendered in the dropdown...

---
#### Creating _Performers_ - Step 4
<br>

- Inside of **controllers/performers.js** we go:

	```js
	const Performer = require('../models/performer');
	
	module.exports = {
	  new: newPerformer
	};
	
	function newPerformer(req, res) {
	  Performer.find({}, function(err, performers) {
	    res.render('performers/new', {
	      title: 'Add Performer',
	      performers
	    });
	  })
	}
	```

---
#### Creating _Performers_ - Step 5
<br>

- We'll need that `new` view that we just rendered:

	```sh
	$ touch views/performers/new.ejs
	```

- The next slide has the markup...

---
#### Creating _Performers_ - Step 5

-  Here's the markup for **performers/new.ejs**:

	```html
	<%- include('../partials/header') %>
	<p>Please first ensure that the Performer is not in the dropdown
	  <select>
	    <% performers.forEach(function(p) { %>
	      <option><%= p.name %></option>
	    <% }) %>
	  </select>
	</p>
	<form id="add-performer-form" action="/performers" method="POST">
	  <label>Name:</label>
	  <input type="text" name="name">
	  <label>Born:</label>
	  <input type="date" name="born">
	  <input type="submit" value="Add Performer">
	</form>
	<%- include('../partials/footer') %>
	``` 

---
#### Creating _Performers_ - CSS

- Find and update in **public/stylesheets/style.css**:

	```css
	#new-form *,
	#add-review-form *,
	#add-performer-form * {
	  font-size: 20px;
	  ...
	}
	...
	#add-review-form,
	#add-performer-form {
	  display: grid;
	  ...
	}	
	...
	#add-review-form input[type="submit"],
	#add-performer-form input[type="submit"] {
	  width: 10rem;
	  ...
	}	
	```

---
#### Creating _Performers_
<br>

- Now for the second request/response cycle to handle the form submission...

- The `action` & `method` on the form look good, we just need to listen to that route.

- **💪 YOU DO: Define the route for the create action**

---
#### Creating _Performers_

- In **controllers/performers.js**:

	```js
	module.exports = {
	  new: newPerformer,
	  create
	};
		
	function create(req, res) {
    // Hack to "fix" date formatting to prevent possible day off by 1
    // https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7556591/is-the-javascript-date-object-always-one-day-off
	  const  s = req.body.born;
	  req.body.born = 
	    `${s.substr(5,2)}-${s.substr(8,2)}-${s.substr(0,4)}`;
	  Performer.create(req.body, function(err, performer) {
	    res.redirect('/performers/new');
	  });
	}
	```

- Okay, give a whirl and let's fix those typos 😊

---
#### Associating Movies and Performers
<br>

- Now that we've added the functionality to create _performers_, we're ready to add the functionality to associate them with _movies_.

- But first, a quick refactor...

---
#### _AAU, after adding a movie, I want to see its details page_
<br>

- This user story can be accomplished with a quick refactor in the `moviesCtrl.create` action in **controllers/movies/js**:

	```js
	movie.save(function(err) {
	  if (err) return res.redirect('/movies/new');
	  // res.redirect('/movies');
	  res.redirect(`/movies/${movie._id}`);
	});
	```

- Don't forget to replace the single-quotes with back-ticks!

- User story done! Now for some fun!

---
#### _AAU, when viewing a movie's detail page,<br>I want to see a list of the current cast and add a new performer to the list_

- Let's ponder what it's going to take to implement this user story:
	- In **movies/show.ejs**, iterate over the movie's cast and use EJS to render them.
	- Hold it! Because we are using referencing, there are `ObjectId`s in a movie's `cast` array - not subdocs. Oh wait, this is what the magical `populate` method is for!
	- Using a form with a dropdown, we can send a request to associate a performer and movie. We will need the list of performers to build the dropdown, but only the performers not already in the cast!

- Let's get started!

---
#### Replacing _ObjectIds_ with the Actual Docs
<br>

- Let's refactor the `moviesCtrl.show` action so that it will pass the movie with the _performer_ documents in its `cast` array instead of `ObjectIds`:

	```js
	function show(req, res) {
	  Movie.findById(req.params.id)
	  .populate('cast').exec(function(err, movie) {
	    res.render('movies/show', { title: 'Movie Detail', movie });
	  });
	}
	```

- `populate`, the unicorn of Mongoose...

---
#### Replacing _ObjectIds_ with the Actual Docs
<br>

- We can chain the `populate` method after any query.

- When we "build" queries like this, we need to call the `exec` method to actually run it (passing in the callback to it).

- **❓ How does the `populate` method know to replace the `ObjectId`s with `Performer` documents?**

---
#### Passing the _Performers_
<br>

- While we're in `moviesCtrl.show`, let's see how we can query for just the _performers_ that are not in the _movie's_ `cast` array.  

- First, we're going to need to access the `Performer` model, so require it at the top:

	```js
	const Movie = require('../models/movie');
	// require the Performer model
	const Performer = require('../models/performer');
	```
	
- Now we're ready to refactor the `show` action... 

---
#### Passing the _Performers_

- We'll review as we refactor the code:

	```js
	
	function show(req, res) {
	  Movie.findById(req.params.id)
	  .populate('cast').exec(function(err, movie) {
	    // Performer.find({}).where('_id').nin(movie.cast)
	    Performer.find(
         {_id: {$nin: movie.cast}},
         function(err, performers) {
           console.log(performers);
           res.render('movies/show', {
             title: 'Movie Detail', movie, performers
           });
         }
       );
	  });
	}
	```
	The log will show we are retrieving the _performers_ - a good sign at this point. 

---
#### Refactor _show.ejs_
<br>

- The next slide has some refactored markup in **movies/show.ejs**.

- It's a bit complex, so we'll review it while we make the changes.

- We'll have to be careful though...

---

```html
  <div><%= movie.nowShowing ? 'Yes' : 'Nope' %></div>
  <!-- start cast list -->
  <div>Cast:</div>
  <ul>
    <%- movie.cast.map(p => 
      `<li>${p.name} <small>${p.born.toLocaleDateString()}</small></li>`
    ).join('') %>
  </ul>
  <!-- end cast list -->
</section>
	
<!-- add to cast form below -->
<form id="add-per-to-cast" action="/movies/<%= movie._id%>/performers" method="POST">
  <select name="performerId">
    <%- performers.map(p => 
      `<option value="${p._id}">${p.name}</option>`
    ).join('') %>
  </select>
  <button type="submit">Add to Cast</button>
</form>
```

---
#### Refactor _show.ejs_ - CSS
<br>

- Add this tidbit of CSS to clean up the cast list:

	```css
	ul {
	  margin: 0 0 1rem;
	  padding: 0;
	  list-style: none;
	}
	
	li {
	  font-weight: bold;
	}
	```

---
#### Need a Route for the _Add to Cast_ Form Post
<br>

- The route is RESTful, but we have to use a non-RESTful name for the controller action because we're creating an association between a movie and a performer...

- In **routes/performers.js**

	```js
	router.post('/movies/:id/performers', performersCtrl.addToCast);
	```
	`addToCast` - not a bad name, but you can use a different one if you want to

---
#### The _addToCast_ Controller Action

- Let's write that `addToCast` action in **controllers/performers.js**:

	```js
	const Performer = require('../models/performer');
	// add the Movie model
	const Movie = require('../models/movie');
	
	module.exports = {
	  new: newPerformer,
	  create,
	  addToCast
	};
	
	function addToCast(req, res) {
	  Movie.findById(req.params.id, function(err, movie) {
	    movie.cast.push(req.body.performerId);
	    movie.save(function(err) {
	      res.redirect(`/movies/${movie._id}`);
	    });
	  });
	}
	```

---
#### We Did It!
<br>

- That was fun!

- A few questions, then on to the lab!

---
### ❓ Essential Questions
<br>

<p>Take a couple of minutes to review...</p>

1. **What property type is used in schemas to reference other documents?**

2. **Describe the difference between 1:M & M:M relationships.**

3. **What's the name of the method used to replace an `ObjectId` with the document it references?**
