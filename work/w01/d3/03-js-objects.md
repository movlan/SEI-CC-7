### What Are Objects?
<br>

- Objects are the most common data structure in _Object Oriented Programming_ (OOP).

- Very simply, **objects** are a collection of zero or more **properties**.

- So what's a _property_? A _property_ consists of a **key: value** pair, where the:
	- **key** is a _string_ or _symbol_ (other types will be coerced into strings), and the
	- **value** is any JS expression (code that evaluates to a single value or thing), including other objects (yes, functions too).

---
### What Are Objects?
<br>

- <p>In computer science, collections of key/value pairs are commonly referred to as dictionaries - a good visualization of what an object is.</p>

---
### Why Objects?
<br>

- In OOP, we often model the goal of our application using real-world objects.

- As developers, you'll be working with objects more than anything else. The following is just a small example of what is modeled using objects:
	- The browser window and the elements it visualizes are all represented in memory as JS objects.
	- Every part of those elements, including their styling, is accessed via JS objects.
	- Data submitted from the browser will be accessed on the server as objects.
	- Data retrieved from a database will be stored in objects.

---
### Why Objects?
<br>

- Even primitive data types like strings and numbers are turned into an object on demand by the JS runtime when we want to call a method like `toUpperCase`!  BTW, this process is called _boxing_.

- Now does it make sense why it's called **Object Oriented Programming**?

---
### Ways to Create Objects
<br>

- There are three different ways we can create objects:
	- By using _Object Literal notation_
	- By invoking a _Class_ (also known as a_Constructor Function_)
	- By using the `Object.create` method

- Today, we're going to focus on using _Object Literals_ to create objects.

- Next week, we'll learn how _Classes_ are used.

- Using `Object.create` is not very common and won't be used during SEI, but as always, you're encouraged to research it.

---
### Creating Objects with<br>Object Literal Notation
<br>

- Create a new Repl and name it something like "JS Objects".

- Now let's create an object by using **Object Literal notation**, also known as an [Object Initializer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer):
	
	```js
	const game = {};
	console.log(typeof game); // "object"
	```

---
### Creating Objects with<br>Object Literal Notation
<br>

- As you can see, _Object Literal notation_ consists of a set of opening  and closing curly braces, `{}`.

- We just used curly braces to create an empty `game` object.<br>**We consider it to be empty because it contains no _________?**

---
### Creating Objects with<br>Object Literal Notation
<br>

- Let's change the code so that `game` has a _property_:

	```js
	const game = {title: 'Guess the Number!'};
	console.log(game);
	```

- Stylistically, defining an object with a single property or a couple of "short" properties on a single line of code like this<br>`let point = {x: 10, y: -5};`<br>isn't a problem (unless it is with your boss).<br>It's all about maintaining readability.

---
### Creating Objects with<br>Object Literal Notation
<br>

- Properties are separated by commas:

	```js
	const game = {
	  title: 'Guess the Number!',
	  biggestNum: 100
	};
	```

- Syntactically, [trailing commas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Trailing_commas) are permitted (in arrays too):

	```js
	const game = {
	  title: 'Guess the Number!',
	  biggestNum: 100,
	};
	```

---
### ‚ùì Properties - Review Questions
<br>

- Considering:

	```js
	const game = {
	  title: 'Guess the Number!',
	  biggestNum: 100,
	};
	```
	
- Answer the following questions:
	- **How many properties does `game` contain?**
	- **What are the keys (AKA property names)?**
	- **What are the property values of `game`?**
	- **What are the data types of the keys?**

---
### Adding Properties to an Existing Object<br>Using Dot Notation

- There are two different syntaxes available to access, add or modify an object's properties:
	- **Dot notation**, and
	- **Square Bracket notation**

- We'll discuss why there are two syntaxes in a bit, for now, let's use _dot notation_ to add another property to the `game` object:
	
	```js
	game.smallestNum = 0;
	```

- Using the _assignment operator_, if a property doesn't exist, it is created, otherwise it's updated.

---
### Adding/Updating Properties<br>Practice (2 min)
<br>

- Using dot notation on the `game` object:
	- Add a property with a key of `numGuesses` set to a value of `0`.
	- Update the `smallestNum` property's value to be `1`.

---
### Accessing Properties with<br>Square Bracket Notation

- The other way to access, add, update and delete properties is by using **square bracket notation**.

- We use _square bracket notation_ instead of _dot notation_ when at the time you're writing the code, you don't know which property needs to be accessed.

- In other words, we use _square brackets_ to access properties _dynamically_ during runtime.

> Less common is to have to resort to using _square brackets_ to access properties when the key name contains a space.

---
### Square Bracket Notation
<br>

- _Square bracket notation_ has the following syntax:

	```js
	someObject[<any JS expression>]
	```
	
- The `<any JS expression>` can be anything that evaluates to a single "value" - even function calls!

---
### Square Bracket Notation

- For example, assume we have an object `words` with "categories" of words:

	```js
	const words = {
	  'animals': ['fox', 'zebra', 'bear', 'turkey'],
	  'colors': ['purple', 'orange', 'green'],
	  // ...other categories
	};
	```
- Now, the program can use a `selectedCategory` variable to access the array of words:

	```js
	const wordList = words[selectedCategory];
	```
	
- Again, we use square bracket notation to access properties dynamically during runtime.

---
### Square Bracket Notation - Practice

- Consider an object that represents a catalog of items where:
	- Each property in the object represents an item for sale
	- The _key_ of each property represents the item's SKU (Stock Keeping Unit - a retail store's unique ID for an item)
	- The _value_ of the property represents the price of the item

- Take a couple of minutes to create another object named `catalog` that includes a few items - but don't delete `game` from the Repl. Again, each item is a _property_ with it's _key_ set to a unique alphanumeric string (a SKU) and its value to a number representing its price.

- Note: If you want to include special characters in the key, just be sure to use quotes.

---
### Square Bracket Notation - Practice
<br>

- Now let's code a price lookup:

	```js
	let sku = '';
	while (sku !== 'quit') {
	  sku = prompt('Enter SKU or "quit" to exit: ');
	  let price = catalog[sku];
	  if (sku !== 'quit') alert(`The price of ${sku} is ${price}`);
	}
	```

- That string in the `alert` is called a **template literal** and is delimited using back-tick characters (it's above the _tab_ key). One of its benefits is that we can use _string interpolation_ to embed the results of JS expressions right into the string using the `${<exp>}` syntax!

---
### Checking if an Object has a Property
<br>

- Notice that if we enter a non-existing SKU (key), we are alerted a price of `undefined`.

- Unlike when we try to access an undeclared variable, we don't receive an error when we access a property that doesn't exist. Instead, `undefined` is returned - nice!

- However, we can't rely on a value of `undefined` to check if a property exists because maybe a property legitimately has a value of `undefined`.

- Instead, we can use the `in` operator...

---
### Checking if an Object has a Property
<br>

- Let's tweak the code to use the `in` operator to check if the user has entered a valid key (SKU):

	```js
	let sku = '';
	while (sku !== 'quit') {
	  sku = prompt('Enter SKU or "quit" to exit: ');
	  if (sku in catalog) {
	    let price = catalog[sku];
	    alert(`The price of ${sku} is ${price}`);
	  } else if (sku !== 'quit') {
	    alert('Invalid SKU - try again');
	  }
	}
	```

- Nice!

---
### Deleting a Property
<br>

- To completely remove a property from an object, we use the `delete` operator:

	```js
	const geniuses = {
	  Einstein: true,
	  Newton: true,
	  Snooki: false
	};
	
	// see ya!
	delete geniuses.Snooki;
	```

- **Try it out!** Use the `delete` operator to remove one of the items from your `catalog` object.

---
### Iterating Over an Object's Properties
<br>

- Before continuing to work with the `game` object, comment out the price lookup code...

- We often need to iterate over an object's properties.

- We can iterate over the _keys_ of the properties using a `for...in` loop:

	```js
	for (let key in game) {
	  console.log(`The value of the ${key} property is ${game[key]}`);
	}
	```

---
### Iterating Over an Object's Properties
<br>

- Note that `for...in` loops include all properties in the _prototype chain_ (inherited properties) - not just its own properties that live on the object itself.

- We'll learn how objects can inherit properties next week.

---
### Iterating Over an Object's Properties
<br>

- There's a couple of nifty ES2017 methods that can be used to iterate over an object's **own**  keys and/or values:
	- [Object.keys(obj)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys)
	- [Object.values(obj)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Object/values)
	- [Object.entries(obj)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries)

- Although cutting edge, these _static_ methods have already been implemented in all modern browsers.

- Again, we'll learn what a _static method_ is next week.

---
### Iterating Over an Object's Properties
<br>

- Each of those methods mentioned returns an array that we can iterate over, for example:

	```js
	Object.values(game).forEach(function(val) {
	  console.log(val);
	});
	```

> Note: The ECMAScript specification does not dictate how properties should be ordered, however, all browsers currently iterator over them in the order they are defined/added.

---
### Property Shorthand Syntax
<br>

- It's a common scenario to want to pass the values of variables as properties (having the same name as the variable) in an object:

	```js
	const latitude = getLat('Disneyland');
	const longitude = getLng('Disneyland');
	
	const location = {
	  name: 'Disneyland',
	  latitude: latitude,
	  longitude: longitude
	};
	```

- ES2015 strikes again...

---
### Property Shorthand Syntax
<br>

- Thanks to ES2015's **Property Shorthand** syntax, we can now do this

	```js
	const latitude = getLat('Disneyland');
	const longitude = getLng('Disneyland');
	
	const location = {
	  name: 'Disneyland',
	  latitude,
	  longitude
	};
	```

- The variable name determines the name of the property.

---
### Methods
<br>

- When a property holds a function, we commonly refer to it as a **method** of the object.

- Let's add a `play` _method_ to the `game` object:

	```js
	game.play = function() {
	  this.secretNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * 
	    (this.biggestNum - this.smallestNum + 1)) + this.smallestNum;
	}
	```

- Try it out in the console by calling `game.play()` and then checking the value of `game.secretNum` a few times.

- What's with the `this`...

---
### Methods
<br>

- The `this` keyword represents the "execution context" of a function.

- In this case, `this` is set by JavaScript to be the object the method is called on.

- We will have a dedicated lesson on `this` next week.

- **IMPORTANT:** Due to how `this` is set within _arrow functions_, it's best to avoid using them as methods in objects.

---
### How Variables Reference an Object
<br>

- As you know, variables are slots in memory that hold a value.

- All non-object data types are known as primitive, or value, types because they hold a single value. Picture a table in memory like this:
	
	```
	SCOPE TABLE            var | value/ref
	                      -----------------
	let x = 25        -->   x  |  25
	var msg = 'hello' -->  msg | 'hello'
	const y = x       -->   y  |  25
	```
	
- But objects are complex/reference types because they can hold multiple pieces of data...

---
### How Variables Reference an Object
<br>

- Objects, including Arrays, Functions, etc. are stored in a separate part of memory known as the _heap_. A variable for an object has as its value a "reference" (think pointer):

	```
	SCOPE TABLE             var | value/ref
	                       -----------------
	let x = 25         -->   x  |  25
	var msg = 'hello'  -->  msg | 'hello'        HEAP 
	const obj = {a: 1} -->  obj |  ref1   --->  {a: 1} <--|
	let arr = [1,2]    -->  arr |  ref2   --->  [1,2]     |
	let obj2 = obj     -->  obj2|  ref1   -----------------
	```

- Similarly, the elements of an array and the properties of an object hold their values in the same way.

---
### How Variables Reference an Object
<br>

<p>Now this all makes sense:</p>

```js
const arr1 = [];
const arr2 = [];
const arr3 = arr1;
arr1 === arr2  // false!
arr3 === arr1 // true!
```

---
### ‚ùì Essential Questions

- **An object is a collection of zero or more ___________.**

- **Properties are _____ : ______ pairs.**

- **Is it more efficient to access properties via dot or square bracket notation?**

- **What type of `for` loop is used to iterate over the keys of an object?**

- **Is the following valid code?**

	```js
	const name = prompt('Enter your name: ');
	const age = prompt('Enter your age: ');
	const person = {name, age};
	```

### Further Study

- [getter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get) and [setter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) properties allow you to treat methods like regular properties that you can access without invoking and set using the assignment operator (`=`).

- [Computed Property Name syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer#Computed_property_names) allows for an expression to determine the key name inside of an object literal - just like using square bracket notation on an existing object.
